        <h1>Introduction to Web Design</h1>
        <h2>Initial Experience</h2>
        <p>This semester has a great beginning.<br>Web development is part of the courses i'm taking this semester.<br>
        freeCodeCamp, a free coding site, introduced by my lecturer, has been a valuable tool for honing my web development skills and as well its applications.<br>
        As a student, I have been assigned to do three modules on the freeCodeCamp as part of my project this semester.<br>
        I started with the "Responsive Web Design" module, where i learned about Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet(CSS).<br>
        I learned various concepts and requirements through guidance provided by fCC in some illustrations.<br>Some of the things that i learned are, the basic structure of an HTML page and also how to apply CSS to an HTMl to define the layout of a web page.<br>
        At the end of each courses, there are projects that awards certificates and there were about five of them.</p>
